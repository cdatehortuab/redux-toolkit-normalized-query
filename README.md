# redux-toolkit-normalized-query
Redux Toolkit Normalized Query is a powerful data fetching and caching tool. It is designed to simplify common cases for loading data in a web application, eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching &amp; caching logic yourself. It mixes the benefits of a normalized state with the caching logic of RTK Query.
